## 🟡 Gold Layer Design
The Gold layer provides analytics-ready fact tables derived from curated Silver datasets. It is designed to support SQL-based analytics, reporting, and BI tools such as Synapse Serverless and Power BI.

### 🎯 Design Principles
- Business-aligned metrics with clear grain
- Long-format tables for flexible analytics
- Standardized time dimensions (year, quarter)
- Optimized for aggregation and filtering
- Delta Lake format for performance and ACID guarantees

### ⭐ Gold Fact Tables
#### 1. fact_electricity_by_fuel (ET5.1)
This table consolidates multiple ET5.1 tables into a single analytics-friendly structure.

##### Grain:
One row per fuel × generator type × metric × time period

##### Metrics Covered:
- Fuel used in electricity generation (Mtoe)
- Electricity generated by fuel (TWh)
- Electricity supplied by fuel (TWh)

##### Key Columns:
- fuel
- generator_type
- metric_type (fuel_used, electricity_generated, electricity_supplied)
- unit
- period_type (annual / quarterly)
- year
- quarter (Q1–Q4, nullable for annual)
- value
- ingestion_date <br>
This design enables flexible trend analysis across fuels, generators, and time periods.

#### 2. fact_electricity_supply_demand (ET5.2)

This table represents electricity supply and demand components at a quarterly level.

##### Grain:
One row per supply/demand component × time period

##### Key Columns:
- supply_demand_component (e.g., total supply, imports, consumption)
- period_type (annual / quarterly)
- year
- quarter (Q1–Q4, nullable for annual)
- unit (GWh)
- value
- ingestion_date
