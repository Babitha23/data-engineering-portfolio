Day 3 - Silver Layer Completion & Portfolio Stabilisation <br>

# 🎯 Objective

Transform ET 5.2 Energy trends dataset from Bronze to Silver layer, aligning schema and transformation logic with ET 5.1. and stabilise GitHub portfolio presentation.

# 🔄 Tasks Completed
- Completed Bronze → Silver transformations for ET 5.2 (Electricity Supply & Demand) dataset
- Applied consistent cleaning logic across ET 5.1 and ET 5.2:
	- Handled complex Excel structures with multiple tables and reporting granularities
	- Standardised column names and schemas
	- Normalised units and metrics for analytical use
- Ensured Delta format storage in Silver layer
- Identified and corrected dataset domain naming:
	- ET 5.1 → Energy Generation by Fuel Type
	- ET 5.2 → Electricity Supply & Demand Components
- Resolved GitHub notebook rendering issues by:
	- Clearing notebook outputs
	- Cleaning metadata
	- Re-committing GitHub-friendly .ipynb files

# 🧠 Key Learnings

- Reusable transformation frameworks significantly reduce development time across similar datasets
- Consistent Silver schemas enable easy Gold-layer aggregation
- GitHub rendering limitations require proactive notebook cleanup
- Clear domain naming significantly improves project clarity
- Excel-based government datasets require robust, reusable cleaning patterns

# ✅ Outcome
- Silver Delta tables for ET 5.2:
	- energy_supply_demand_trends_main
	- energy_supply_demand_trends_annual
	- energy_supply_demand_trends_quarterly
- Silver layer for Energy Trends datasets is now:
	- Clean
	- Consistent
	- Analytics-ready
	- Professionally documented
	- GitHub-reviewable
# Status: 
✅ Completed successfully
